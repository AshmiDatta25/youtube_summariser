HAN
Did you enjoy your meal?
Not really
We just had sushi here in the U.S.
-Yeah
-With Mr. HAN
Yeah
It was delicious
Why do you always call me Mr. HAN when the camera’s on...
I mean...
This isn’t even an official setting,
so why do you keep calling me that?
Hey, Mr. SEO!
Mr. SEO!
-Hey, HANNIE
-HANNIE!
Hannie, did you enjoy your food?
It was great
You didn’t like me calling you Mr. Han?
Yeah, it made me sad
-It did?
-Yeah!
Okay, Mr. Han!
Okay
Alright then
Mission
Daily TALKER in the green room
Go find members who are resting in the dressing room
and chat with them about what they're doing
I.N!
Lotte lost yesterday?
Starting the day with baseball talk
That’s Seungmin and our SKZ keeper for you
First up
Let’s start with the greens
Veggies taste best when eaten with your hands
I'll just take one piece of kimchi
Grab it yourself!
Do you want some kimchi?
I have plenty left, want some?
Today’s mission
1. Gather members you want to film a challenge with and shoot it
And number 2
Act as the members’ physical therapist
Okay
Easy
While I get ready today
Please keep an eye on me
Thank you
Time to give I.N a massage
Your calves aren’t doing great
Lots of tension here
But I just got them loosened up
You did?
Sorry
You're a scammer
I’m fixing it
Let me realign your toes
Can toes be alinged?
Of course, totally do-able
Feels like it's getting misaligned
Let’s go
Say it one more time
Let's go
Let’s go
Today's ATiiSSU hat
Just got a new one!
I think the color is really pretty!
What makes this hat cute?
The strap
Let’s go
Earlier in the waiting room
when the others were eating,
Yongbok and Hyunjin didn’t eat then,
and now they’re eating here
Is it good? Do you like today’s menu?
It’s good
Now that we’re at it, let’s take a two-shot
Now that's a solo shot
Yongbok, let’s get a two-shot? Okay
Whoa, nice…
Triple shot
As you can see, there’s a lot on the menu
Seasoned pork ribs here
Pork belly and braised pollack
Oh, braised pollack! That looks good
There’s also stir-fried squid
Packed with protein
Hey Yongbok!
During the live yesterday, someone commented
that deeper a guy's voice, the more likely he is to be a playboy
A playboy?
Yeah, the deeper the voice,
the higher the chance of being a playboy
Oh really?
So what about you? Are you a playboy?
Oh, they say Yongbok’s a playboy
Yongbok
-Yongbok, are you a playboy?
-He’s a playboy
Hmm I don’t even know
Maybe he’s not then
I’m not really sure
Seems like Yongbok isn’t a playboy, everyone
Let’s say he’s the devoted type
-Let’s go
-Go go
Speed up
You drive well
No big deal!
Wow look at him driving with one hand
Tied my hair up again today
Now I’m back in the waiting room
Hair, makeup and touch-ups done
How do I look?
Let’s do great again today
Let’s go
I’ve been to Texas a few times, but it’s our first time in Arlington
Nice to meet you
We’re back from the show
After the show,
Kim Seungmin barged into my room
As you can see here
in blue
Like the baseball...
What’s it called? Face paint?
Oh, that thing under the eyes pitchers use?
Yeah, outfielders use it too
To keep from getting blinded by the light?
Because STAY were too dazzling
They got us ribs for a late-night snack
Looks good, right?
Now, I'm good at setting up the framing, too!
I’m eating beef ribs
We worked really hard today too
Seriously, the fans were so sweet
They greeted us
It was such a fun and happy day
I'm going to wash up and get some good sleep now
Bye
Here’s today’s lunch
Everyone’s eating right now
That’s it!
Did that one feel okay?
But you need to grab it so it makes a solid smack sound here
That’s it!
Nice!
Nice
This feels like around 20kg?
Maybe a little more than 20kg
To warm up
These are in pounds, okay?
It’s 25 pounds, so…
If you just cut it roughly in half, it's about 12kg
Alright, grab your dumbbells
Don’t just lie down right away
First rest them on your knees
Lift them up!
As you lie down, extend your arms at the same time
As you lie down, stretch your arms out like this
If you overextend, you'll hurt your arms
Lower them slightly
Then push up!
Focus more on the release than the contraction
Snap into the contraction!
Then take 3 seconds to release
Just remember: 1 for contraction, 3 for release
How many reps do you think you can do?
10?
It’s 30kg, so I should be able to do 10 reps
Alright, let’s go
I do anaerobic exercises too!
I even worked out this morning
I think I do it about four times a week
And cardio too
I usually do cardio after anaerobic
I do cardio like three times a week
Left-handed pitcher SKZ keeper
This place is
The home stadium of the Texas Rangers
A lot of Korean players actually
Played here as team members
Like Chan Ho Park, Shin-Soo Choo
And even Yang Hyeon-jong for a bit
It’s a place with a lot of history
The fact that we’re performing here
Is just incredible and really emotional too
And today!
We're going up for the encore in our jerseys
They gifted us
They even added our initials at the back

Seungmin asked me
to produce a song called "GoodBye"
We actually recorded previously
but it's been a while since that version
so he wanted to release it soon
but I thought his current tone of voice
would suit the song even better
So we re-recorded it, and the result came out even better
Then Seungmin kept on pushing me to wrap it up quickly
So I thought, okay this won’t do
I worked on the tuning until like 6 or 7 in the morning
And then...
Might as well, right?
You should've stayed up all night till 11am
and even mixed it too
(just kidding) I basically took away one of Bang Chan's days off
No, I liked it
-I actually like resting while working on stuff like that
-Really?
Yeah! You know how I am
[Arlington Felix’s Mission
1 Film a challenge with a member of his choice

I found a new TikTok trend
And HAN offered to do it with me
HAN said he'd help me with the mission
He said yes
-Let’s do it!
Come here!
Where should we shoot it?
Right here is good
Is there any massage you don’t like?
Is there any kind you hate?
-You don’t like this?
-I do
Chest
Three
Four
Five
But honestly, it’s not bad at all
There are simple challenges like this too
I gave a foot massage for I.N
And I filmed a short-form with a member too
I completed it, right?
